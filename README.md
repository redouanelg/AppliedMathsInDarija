Series of Beamer presentations on some topics in Applied Maths written in Moroccan Darija. The targetted crowd are high school students, Prépas students and Master of Engineering students.

This is a pop science personal project that I wanted to start for a long time. I hope it will make moroccan students interested in applied maths in general and in its applications in particular. Pursuing a career in scientific research is not an easy path in Morocco, so I hope I can transfer at least my passion towards scientific research to the next generations.

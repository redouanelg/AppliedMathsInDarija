Topics on Applied Maths in Moroccan Darija

Series of Beamer presentations on some topics in Applied Maths written in Moroccan Darija. The targetted crowd are high school students, Prépas students and Master of Engineering students.

This is a pop science personal project that I wanted to start for a long time. I hope it will make moroccan students interested in applied maths in general and in its applications in particular. Pursuing a career in scientific research is not an easy path in Morocco, so I hope I can transfer at least my passion towards scientific research to the next generations.
